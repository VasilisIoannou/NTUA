## **Installation**  
Steps to install the project:  

1. Clone the repo: 

```
    git clone https://github.com/VasilisIoannou/DatabaseNTUA
    cd DatabaseNTUA
```
<br>
2. Set up MariaDB:


```
    mysql -u root -p < install.sql
```
<br>
3. Generate dummy data:
<br>

```
    mysql -u root -p festivalDB < load.sql
```

4. Test Query:

```
    mysql -u root -p festivalDB < Q01.sql
```
Note: Some test Queries are in the folder ./sql/Query


## Usage Examples:

- Query Artist By Age:
```  
    SELECT * FROM artist WHERE artist_age < 35;
```
- Add a New festival:

```
    INSERT INTO festival (festival_year, festival_month, festival_day, duration, location_id) VALUES (2030, 10, 20, 5, 10);
```
<br>
<div>
    The above will create an instance of the festival starting 20/10/2030 (DD/MM/YYYY) until 25/10/2030
    Note: For the Instance of the Festival to be created the instance of location/coordinates must already exist.
